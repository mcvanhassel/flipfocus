        Privacy-first utility apps built with the belief that your data should

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        FlipFocus was born from a simple frustration: why should organizing your
        photos require uploading them to someone else's servers? As a solo
        developer, I believe in creating tools that respect your privacy and
        work entirely offline.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We're committed to building privacy-first utility apps that solve real
        problems without compromising your data. Every FlipFocus app operates
        100% offline, ensuring your files never leave your device.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy Commitment</h2>
